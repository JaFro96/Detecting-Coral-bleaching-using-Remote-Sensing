# Detecting Coral bleaching using Remote Sensing 
 
We chose as a taks for our Remote Sensing study project at the Institute of Geoinformatics in MÃ¼nster to detect the coral bleaching process for the last years on the Maldives.
To do that we executed the following steps:
1. Data acquisition - we chose __planetScope data__ due to a high spatial resolution of 3 meters ([Image courtesy of Planet Labs, Inc.](https://www.planet.com/))
2. Subdeviding the data into extens where we found a high occurrence of corals
3. Chosing certain pixel that we expect to be corals
4. Calculate a normalized darkness of each pixel for the time series between 2016 and 2019
5. Making a trend analysis

Steps 2 to 5 can be tracked in this following [R script](https://github.com/bennidietz/Detecting-Coral-bleaching-using-Remote-Sensing/blob/master/how_to.R)
